# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am **Nehemiah Dias** and I am a **Design Engineer** at bp pulse fleet. I am skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Tailwind, Vite, React, Python, and C++/C# with the dedication to learn much more! I'm interested in Game Development to further season my programming skills as I become a more well rounded full stack engineer.
